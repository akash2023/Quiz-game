This game is an open source project by me,and has no copyrights.
The game consists of two rounds- warmpup round and cash price round.
In warmup round user would be asked three questions. if user answers correctly any two of three asked questions 
he/she is allowed to sit for next round.
Note - No prizes are awarded in this round.
In CP round there would be 10 questions each having 4 options out of which only one is correct.
User needs to enter the desired option name using keyboard
In this round user would be awarded with $100,000 for each correct answer.
Game would be terminated if either user enters wrong answer or user's cash price has reached 1 million dollars.
User can use a lifeline named as "50-50" which will remove two of the wrong options in a question twice in a game.
A help menu is provided in the game that mentions all the rules and controls
Users would be able to see the high scores of the participants of the game.
A section is incorporated in which users can enter their feedback/suggestions for further improvement of the game.
